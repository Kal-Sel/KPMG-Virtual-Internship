# KPMG-Virtual-Internship
Virtual Internship offered by Forage

For this virtual internship, I had to do 3 main tasks:
1. __Data Quality Assessment__ (Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis)
2. __Data Insights__ (Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes)
3. __Data Insights and Presentation__ (Using visualisations to present insights)

For the Data Quality Assessment task, I had to go through the [KPMG_raw_data_update_final.xlsx](https://github.com/Kal-Sel/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/KPMG_raw_data_update_final.xlsx) dataset and ensure the readines for the analysis in the second step. After identifying the data quality issues ([Sprocket_Copy.xlsx](https://github.com/Kal-Sel/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Sprocket_Copy.xlsx)), I had to write an email([Email.pdf](https://github.com/Kal-Sel/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Email.pdf)) to the customer to let him know what the quality issues were.

In the second step I had to prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities â€“ i.e. *understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation* and *reporting* and present it all in a Powerpoint presentation([Sprocket_Copy.pdf](https://github.com/Kal-Sel/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Sprocket_Copy.pdf)).  

The third step was to visualize the insights with a visualization tool, in this case with __*Power BI*__, and the dashboard can be accessed here [Spreadsheet.pdf](https://github.com/Kal-Sel/KPMG-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Spreadsheet.pdf).
